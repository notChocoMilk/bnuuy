bnuuy is a discord bot that exists in time, truly a beautiful bot.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don’t expect to be forgiven. I’m simply here to apologize for recommending discord.py. if you or a loved one has used bnuuy before, please run 'pip uninstall discord.py', and 'pip install py-cord' before it's too late.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
i forgot how to make a license, so i'll just put it here
-------------
uhh, idk if this is a real license, but do whatever you want with this lol, just link my youtube channel or smth
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISCLAIMER: this is only bnuuy 1.0, not 1.1 or 2.0. 2.0 is just a fork of fumobot, a more advanced (similar to bnuuy) discord bot that will go open source at a later date. you are free to do anything you want to with this bot (as long as it doesn't violate tos), but if possible, at least stating something along the lines of "based on bnuuy#1875" or something would be nice
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
donjamie, why do you love this bot so much
